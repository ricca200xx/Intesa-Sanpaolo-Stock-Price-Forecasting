- follow forecasting process shown in the introductory slides
- consider testing for multicollinearity (VIF, reference: 01 linear regeression)
- when testing for linear model, consider analysing the possible limitation as stated in slide 16 of the 01 linear regression model, do it aloud 
- also ANOVA everything!!
NOTE: If multicollinearity is present, consider using s - 1 dummy (s: number of periods) to account for it
- ==plot everything and comment everything, especially residuals -> do graphical examination== 
- also do tests, especially on residuals, and explain and comment them
- testing parameterization with AIC and explaining why AIC over other means of predictors selection
